# 🫀 HeartRiskDetector-AI  

**HeartRiskDetector-AI** is a web-based application that predicts the risk of heart disease using basic health parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar.  
It combines a trained machine learning model with a modern frontend for quick, reliable, and accessible health insights.

## 🚀 Features  

- 📊 **AI-powered predictions** – instantly classify users as *At Risk* / *Not at Risk*.  
- 🖥 **Simple web interface** – built with React, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind.  
- 🔄 **Reusable ML pipeline** – preprocessing + model integration.  
- ⚡ **Fast and lightweight** – deployable on cloud hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).  
- 🧩 **Extendable** – easy to add more parameters, models, or datasets.
